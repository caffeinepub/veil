The codes VEIL-001, VEIL-002, VEIL-003, VEIL-004, and VEIL-005 must be present and valid in the InviteCodes stable state immediately after canister deployment or upgrade. Ensure the seeding logic runs in the actor's initialization (or postupgrade hook) so codes are never absent on a fresh deploy. Verify that validateInviteCode returns true for each of these codes before they are used, and that the register function correctly marks them as used upon successful registration.",
