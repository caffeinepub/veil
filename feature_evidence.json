In useQueries.ts and any component that calls backend functions, gate all actor calls behind a check that the identity from useInternetIdentity is authenticated (isAuthenticated is true and the identity is not the anonymous identity). If the identity is anonymous or absent, return early or skip the query — do not dispatch the call to the actor.",
