The diff shows: EMOTION_GUIDANCE constants with exact required strings, per-mode tonal CSS tokens (happy/confess/broke bg/text/accent), EMOTION_GUIDANCE_STYLES and EMOTION_FORM_STYLES applied in PostCreationPage, and a safety footer described as appearing only when BROKE + PUBLIC. The guidance text strings match exactly as specified. No hallucinated features detected beyond the scope of the requirements.",
