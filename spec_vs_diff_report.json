  "summary": "The diff implements a text-based reaction system across backend and frontend. However, the hook names in useQueries.ts diverge from the required names in REQ-2, and the backend exposes functions under different names than specified in REQ-1. REQ-3 appears largely implemented in PublicPostCard.tsx. Several naming discrepancies exist between the spec and the implementation.",

      "requirement": "Expose `addReaction(postId: Text, reactionText: Text)` and `getReactionsForPost(postId: Text)` as the public backend function names.",
      "reason": "The backend diff shows a `textReactions` map and a `TextReaction` type, and frontend-file-summaries.txt confirms the implemented functions are named `addTextReaction` and `getTextReactionsForPost`, not `addReaction` and `getReactionsForPost` as required.",

      "requirement": "The reactions stable table must be named `reactions` per the spec.",
      "reason": "The backend implements the table as `textReactions` (Map.empty<Text, TextReaction>()) rather than `reactions` as specified. The type is also named `TextReaction` instead of `Reaction` with the required fields.",

      "reason": "The frontend-file-summaries.txt explicitly states the hooks were implemented as `useTextReactionsForPost` and `useAddTextReaction`, not `useAddReaction` and `usePostReactions` as required by REQ-2.",

      "description": "A separate legacy `Reaction` type and `reactions` map using emoji/type-based reactions are retained alongside the new `TextReaction` type and `textReactions` map, resulting in two parallel reaction systems in the backend.",
      "reason": "The spec only requested a single reactions stable table with the TextReaction schema. The diff retains the old `Reaction` type with `reactionType: ReactionType` and a separate `reactions` map, which was not requested.",

      "description": "Hook names `useTextReactionsForPost` and `useAddTextReaction` and backend function names `getTextReactionsForPost` and `addTextReaction` were introduced instead of the names specified in the build request.",
      "reason": "The build request specifies exact names: `useAddReaction`, `usePostReactions`, `addReaction`, and `getReactionsForPost`. The implementation uses different names throughout without any stated justification.",
