  "summary": "The diff modifies PublicPostCard.tsx (frontend component), a frontend file summaries text file, and project_state.json. Neither the backend getPublicPosts query nor the CommunityFeedPage component appears to have been substantively changed to enforce the required behavior. The project_state.json marks both REQ-1 and REQ-2 as 'pending', and the CommunityFeedPage.tsx summary only mentions auth guard changes — not removal of explore sections, client-side sorting, or metrics. The PublicPostCard.tsx diff shows the component still includes reaction counts, comment counts, and engagement UI (reactions, comments, flagging), which conflicts with REQ-2's AC requiring no engagement metrics on feed post cards.",
