  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required visibility enforcement features. Frontend changes (PostCard, MyPostsPage) clearly address REQ-4. Backend changes in main.mo appear to include visibility types and post structures. However, the backend diff is heavily truncated, making it difficult to confirm full implementation of REQ-1 (private post filtering in feed queries, per-ID access control) and REQ-2 (chronological ordering, no reshare methods). The CommunityFeedPage file summary mentions auth guard changes but does not explicitly confirm removal of share/reshare UI elements (REQ-3), and the PublicPostCard component is not shown in the diff at all.",
